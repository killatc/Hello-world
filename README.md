# Hello-world
Hi humans
Let me tell you Lima,
Let me tell you the glory
Of the dream that evokes memory
From the old bridge, the river and the mall.
Let me tell you Lima,
Now that you still perfume the memory,
Now that he still rocks in a dream,
The old bridge, the river and the mall.
Jasmine in the hair and roses on the face,
Airosa walked the cinnamon flower,it spilled smoothness and in its wake left
Aromas of mistura in his chest.
